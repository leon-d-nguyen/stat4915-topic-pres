# Problem Description 

## Problem Description 

+ Different progressions in career trajectories can aid in understanding disparities
+ Studying job mobility in the United States is critical to understanding patterns that could be indicative of systemic behaviors
+ Pew Research study: during Great Resignation, Black and Hispanic populations were more likely to change jobs compared to White and Asian demographics
+ Younger workers also more likely to change jobs in a given month compared to older demographics (Kochhar et al., 2022)
+ Mainstream focus on how US immigration has embolstered the labor force during and post-pandemic
+ The H-1B work visa is a high volume “temporary work visa” reserved for high-skilled professionals, requiring a bachelor’s degree or higher for acquisition. Shortages of people working in STEM fields has been synonymous with the shortage of “high-skilled” workers; as a result, the H-1B work visa prioritizes educational degrees in STEM fields and gives some advantages to US advanced degrees by raising the cap on visas issued (Teitelbaum, 2018).
+ One assumption is that foreign degrees are less valuable than domestic degrees for hiring and wages in the U.S. and Canadian labor markets, based on various studies (e.g. Damelang et al., 2020; Lancee and Bol, 2017; Zeng and Xie, 2004)

# Objectives and Research Questions
## Objectives and Research Questions

Focus on a primary data source analysis to identify patterns or disparities that may exist in the labor market between different demographics within the Indian immigrant subpopulation prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, what factors may contribute to said disparities, as well as identify potential solutions to address them. 

**Research Questions:**

+ Are there significant differences between how people move between jobs versus between companies?
+ Are there significant differences between different demographics of gender, highest education level, and U.S./Foreign Degrees?
+ Do external job changes affect how we define job to job movement? If so, how?


# Data Description
## Data Description

+ Primary dataset webscraped from LinkedIn provided by advisor, collected as of early 2019
+ Observations ($n=7,597$) consist of people with a Bachelor's degree from the U.S. or India
+ Publicly available LinkedIn profile with their career progression
+ Roughly $70+$ features, narrowed down to 8, some of which are constructed
+ Most data is discrete or categorical, if numerical then involves monthly increments
+ Some information is truncated or rounded by nature of the dataset

# Response Variable Construction

## General Approach

Things to consider:

+ How can we measure internal and external job changes?
+ How can we measure the direction and magnitude of job changes?
+ Promotions, demotions, lateral/stagnant movement?
+ How do we standardize information about jobs with so many of them?

## General Approach (cont.)

Internal Job Changes:

+ Identify common job titles, common bigrams
+ Assign point values to bigrams containing certain words
+ Translate bigram point values to job title point values

External Job Changes:

+ Comparing company names between job $n$ and job $n+1$
+ Fuzzy matching to compare strings
+ Similarity score threshold

## Bigram Point Scale

Five categories:

+ 5 - presidents, ceos, founders
+ 4 - managers
+ 3 - mid-level staff
+ 2 - lower-level staff
+ 1 - students, interns, assistants

Each job title will then take the minimum or average point value of the bigrams it contains.

## External Job Changes 

+ **Exact String Matching**:
    - Compares company names of job n and job n+1 for an exact match. 
    - If names are identical, no external job change; otherwise, an external job change is recorded. 
    - Limitation: Does not account for spelling errors or variations (e.g., "Google" vs. "Google Inc."). 

+ **Fuzzy String Matching**:
    - Uses similarity scores (0-100) to compare company names, with a threshold of 85 for similarity. 
    - If the score is above 85, no external job change; below 85, an external job change is recorded. 
    - Advantage: More tolerant of spelling errors or minor variations in company names. 

# Analysis

## Descriptive Analysis: Internal Job Changes

Using the *minimum* bigram point value for each job title, the distribution of job title 
point values and point differences between job $n$ and job $n+1$ are as follows:

## Analysis Techniques

**Goal:** Determine what factors are statistically significant when internal or external 
job changes occur, as well as the type and frequency of movement. Statistical methods 
would help us analyze if there exists statistically significant differences between selected 
demographics in the sample. Logistic regression models are constructed to assess relationships 
between variables and response. 

Possible Models of interest:

+ Likelihood of ever experiencing a promotion 
+ Likelihood of ever experiencing a demotion
+ Likelihood of ever experiencing an external job change (exact string matching)
+ Likelihood of ever experiencing an external job change (fuzzy string matching)

Additional procedures for variable subset selection:

+ LASSO 
+ Elastic Net 
+ Stepwise Regression 

Full models are fed through variable subset selection processes, and reduced models are 
constructed based on the selected variables.

## Logistic Regression

Current response variables:

+ Likelihood of experiencing a promotion
+ Likelihood of experiencing a demotion
+ Likelihood of experiencing an external job change (exact)
+ Likelihood of experiencing an external job change (fuzzy)

Explanatory variables for modeling include:

+ **Gender** : '0' is encoded for male, '1' is encoded for female
+ **US BA** : '0' is encoded for India, '1' is encoded for US
+ **Has Advanced Degree** : '0' for neither Master's nor Doctorate, '1' for either or both
+ **Adv. Deg. from US** : '0' for only received advanced degrees abroad, and '1' for any advanced degree in the US
+ **STEM BA Field** : '0' for non-STEM or unknown BA, '1' for STEM BA
+ **STEM Adv. Deg.** :  '0' for only non-STEM, and '1' for any advanced degree in STEM
+ **Yrs. Working in US**
+ **Yrs. Studied in US**

Models have low predictive performance, but we are more interesting in substantive results 
from coefficients and significance. As models are reduced, multicollinearity is less of a 
problem. Data imbalance is an issue, but because we want to interpret coefficients and we 
are not as concerned with prediction compared to a more holistic analysis, oversampling 
techniques were avoided. 

We note that the response variables for **Any External Job Change** were initially two separate 
variables depending on the use of exact string matching versus fuzzy string matching. Because 
the response variables were identical, they would create the same logistic regression models and 
have the same subset of variables included in the reduced model. For clarity, we have now only one 
response variable relating to **Any External Job Change**.
<!-- TODO: cut down on wordiness? -->

## Variable Subset Selection

+ **LASSO**: Uses L1 regularization to shrink less significant variable coefficients to zero. 
    - Two models are created per response variable.
    - `lambda.min`: Minimizes prediction error using cross-validation (10 folds).
    - `lambda.1se`: Provides a simpler, more parsimonious model within 1 standard error of `lambda.min`.

+ **Elastic Net**: 
    - Combines L1 and L2 penalties to handle multicollinearity better than LASSO. 
    - Two models are created per response variable: `lambda.min` and `lambda.1se` are used, similar to LASSO.
    - Data is split 50/50 into training and testing sets, iterating over the `alpha` mixing parameter.

+ **Stepwise Regression**: 
    - Selects variables one by one
    - Based on AIC improvement
    - **Forward Stepwise**: Starts with an intercept-only model, adding variables one at a time.
    - **Backward Stepwise**: Starts with all variables, removing them one at a time.
    - Final model is selected when AIC no longer improves.


# Results and Discussion

## Selected Variables

We include the variable in a final reduced model if it was selected by at least 
four out of the six methods. However, we include our variables of interest regardless 
of the number of times they were selected, i.e., Gender, US BA, Adv. Deg from US, and 
Has Advanced Degree. The goal of variable selection is to reduce the number of 
predictor variables in the model, reducing multicollinearity and improving interpretability.

## Results (Predictive Metrics)

Condensing information from full and reduced models:

+	**AIC:**
    +	Ever experienced promotion: full: 4663.2, reduced: 4659.8
    +	Ever experienced demotion: full: 5188.2, reduced: 5186.9
    +	Any external job change: full: 191.81, reduced: 187.92
+	**McFadden R2:** 
    +	Ever experienced promotion: full: 0.01342832, reduced: 0.01330522
    +	Ever experienced demotion: full: 0.0178604, reduced: 0.01696404
    +	Any external job change: full: 0.2020811, reduced: 0.1924185
+	**Optimal cutoff:**
    +	Ever experienced promotion: full: 0.4110361, reduced: 0.4163346
    +	Ever experienced demotion: full: 0.5145902, reduced: 0.5107074
    +	Any external job change: full: 0.91, reduced: 0.94
+	**Misclassification error:** (0.5 and optimal cutoff) 
    +	Ever experienced promotion: full: (0.3143, 0.313), reduced: (0.3143, 0.3143)
    +	Ever experienced demotion: full (0.4177, 0.4146), reduced: (0.4172, 0.4146)
    +	Any external job change: full (0.0029, 0.0034), reduced: (0.0029, 0.0121)
+	**ROC:**
    +	Ever experienced promotion: full: 0.5771, reduced: 0.5752
    +	Ever experienced demotion: full 0.601, reduced: 0.6053
    +	Any external job change: full 0.7112, reduced: 0.7108

From our predictive metrics: 

+ The AIC values between full and reduced models are similar, with slight decreases, indicating no significant loss in model performance. 
+ Pseudo-R-squared values, ROC AUC values, and misclassification errors remain consistent between full and reduced models.
+ Optimal cutoff probabilities shifted slightly towards 0.5, except for "Any External Job Change," which increased from 0.91 to 0.94.
+ Reducing predictor variables improved interpretability and reduced multicollinearity without significantly affecting model performance (reduction in VIF). 
+ Variable importance is generally in line with the significance of the variables; variables that contribute more to model prediction are often viewed as more significant.

Based on our models, we conclude the following: 

+ The sign of coefficients remains consistent between full and reduced models, indicating stable relationships between predictors and responses.
+ Results from both the full and reduced model reinforce the interpretation that as the **number of years working in the U.S.** increases, the likelihood of experiencing mobility (any type of movement) increases.
+ Having an **advanced degree from the U.S.** is associated with a higher likelihood of promotion, which is consistent with the assumption that having an advanced U.S. degree is better than foreign advanced degrees. 
+ However, having an **advanced degree from the U.S.** is also associated with a higher likelihood of demotion, challenging the assumption that a U.S. degree always provides a strict advantage in the labor market. 
+ The sign of the coefficient for **US BA** is negative, which indicates that having a Bachelor’s degree from India is associated with a higher likelihood of promotion, demotion, or external job change. 
+ Gender does not appear to have a significant effect on job mobility based on the models. 
+ The country where the degree was obtained significantly affects job mobility, with mixed results. 
+ Having an advanced degree *in general* does not significantly affect job mobility, but having one from the U.S. does. 
+ This may point to a different interpretation where having a U.S. degree is associated with a higher likelihood of job stability, whereas people with degrees from abroad may experience more job mobility or volatility. 

##  Limitations

+ Data collection is done via webscraping; data input will be inconsistent across different people
+ Employment history and duration may not be up to date (as of 2019)
+ Five-point scale is relatively subjective, constructed metric
+ System is not perfect!
+ Imbalances in data, namely "any external changes" variable (proving to be an issue in logistic regression)
+ We assume Indian origin based on provided characteristics, such as attendance of high school in India and native fluency in Hindi
+ STEM field definition is provided by U.S. Department of Homeland Security (2019) for H-1B visas

# Further Investigation
## Further Investigation

+ Compare pre-COVID baseline behavior to current Indian immigrant sample post-COVID 
+ Refine job title categorization / point value assignment process with LLM (i.e. general embeddings) 
    + Assigning point values by cluster of job titles / bigrams
+ Scale the magnitude of differences between point value levels 
+ Data colllection of more quantitative variables?
