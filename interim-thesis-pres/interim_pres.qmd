# What is the Data Science Pipeline?

## What is the Data Science Pipeline?

+ Framework for data insights
+ Raw data into actionable answers
+ Flexible!

![](./figures/datasci_pipeline.png){.lightbox}

## Parts of the Data Science Pipeline  

1. **Research Question:** What questions are you trying to get answered?
1. **Data Collection:** What data is useful for answering your questions?
1. **Data Cleaning:** How should you process your data?
1. **Data Visualization:** What can we see about your data?
1. **Data Modeling:** What models are appropriate for your data?
1. **Data Storytelling:** What insights can we learn from your data?


# Research Question

## What guides your research/inquiry?  

+ Backbone of your project
+ "...explore an existing uncertainty in an area of concern and points to a need for deliberate investigation" (Ratan et al, 2019).
    + Details the problem statement
    + Further describes and refines the issue under study
    + Adds focus to the problem statement
    + Sets context of research
    + **Guides data collection and analysis.**
+ What are you curious about?

<!-- ## In context

# Data Collection

## Data Collection  

+ Defined as "the process of gathering and analyzing accurate data from various sources to find answers to research problems, trends and probabilities, etc., to evaluate possible outcomes" (Jain, 2024).
+ Main objective is to gather information-rich and reliable data, and analyze them to make critical business decisions (Duggal, 2024).
    + What types of data sources?
    + "Garbage in, garbage out" principle
    + Do I have enough data?
    + Multiple features

## Data Sources  

Pre-built data sources:

+ Kaggle: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
+ Governmental sites, CDC, Departmental sites, etc.
+ OpenData NYC
+ GitHub: [https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets)

Web Scraping

+ e.g. Webpages with big tables, LinkedIn data
+ Takes more time, but more flexible
+ BeautifulSoup: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVv6mJpFOb0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVv6mJpFOb0)



# Data Cleaning

## What should be cleaned?  

+ Can you drop irrelevant/empty columns?
+ Are there data entries with ambiguous/invalid characters? (e.g. entries in various languages)
+ Is data typecasted correctly?
+ Are null values coded in different ways? (e.g. "null" vs "NA")
+ Can you conserve space with simpler datatypes? (e.g. encoding strings with integers?)
+ Can you standardize values? (e.g. "canada", "Canada", and "CANADA")
+ Duplications?

## Data Cleaning in Python: Pandas

“Pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis 
and manipulation tool.” [https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)

# Data Visualization

## Types of Data Visualizations

Depending on the context of your data and what insights are useful:

::: {layout-ncol=2}

+ Scatter plot with line of best fit
+ Jittering with stripplot
+ Marginal Boxplot
+ Correlogram
+ Pairwise Plot
+ Waffle Chart
+ Pie Chart
+ Treemap
+ Bar Chart
+ [...and other types!](https://www.machinelearningplus.com/plots/top-50-matplotlib-visualizations-the-master-plots-python/)

![Plot of NYC done with `matplotlib`, `contextily`, `seaborn`](./figures/NYCplot.png){width=80% .lightbox}

## Tools for Data Visualization

Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotnine are great packages for data visualization; you can create static, animated, and interactive visualizations!

Geopandas is great with geographic information.

# Data Modeling

## What is the role of AI and ML in Data Science?

::: {layout-ncol=2}

+ **Artificial Intelligence:** broad concept of developing machines simulating human thinking, reasoning and behavior.
+ **Machine Learning:** a subset of AI where computer systems learn from the environment to improve experiences and processes.
+ **Data Science:** a distinct discipline with overlap/application in the fields of AI and ML, but not a subset of either.

## What are models used for?

There are various types of modeling depending on your research questions of interest:

+ **Predictive Modeling:** Using historical data to predict future outcomes.
+ **Descriptive Modeling:** Identifying patterns and relationships in data.
+ **Prescriptive Modeling:** Recommending actions based on data analysis.
+ **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points together.
+ **Classification:** Assigning data points to predefined categories.
+ **Regression:** Predicting a continuous outcome variable based on one or more predictor variables.

## Data Evaluation

+ **Accuracy:** How often is the model correct?
+ **Precision:** When it predicts positive, how often is it correct?
+ **Recall:** When it's actually positive, how often does it predict positive?
+ **ROC Curve:** A graphical plot illustrating the diagnostic ability of a binary classifier.
+ **Cross-Validation:** Technique for assessing how the results of a statistical analysis will generalize to an independent dataset.
+ Word of caution: "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure"

# Data Storytelling

## What now?  

+ How to present and communicate your work
+ What does the data support?
+ Context and domain knowledge
+ What does this mean?


## Conclusion

Having a clear framework in place can guide you to make decisions that drive your inquiries, from dirty data to actionable insights!
