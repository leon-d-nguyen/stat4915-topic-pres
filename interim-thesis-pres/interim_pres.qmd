# Problem Description 

## Problem Description 

+ Different progressions in career trajectories can aid in understanding disparities
+ Studying job mobility in the United States is critical to understanding patterns that could be indicative of systemic behaviors
+ Pew Research study: during Great Resignation, Black and Hispanic populations were more likely to change jobs compared to White and Asian demographics
+ Younger workers also more likely to change jobs in a given month compared to older demographics (Kochhar et al., 2022)
+ Mainstream focus on how US immigration has embolstered the labor force during and post-pandemic


# Objectives and Research Questions
## Objectives and Research Questions

Focus on a primary data source analysis to identify patterns or disparities that may exist in the labor market between different demographics within the Indian immigrant subpopulation prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, what factors may contribute to said disparities, as well as identify potential solutions to address them. 

**Research Questions:**

+ Are there significant differences between how people move between jobs versus between companies?
+ Are there significant differences between different demographics of gender, highest education level, and U.S./Foreign Degrees?
+ Do external job changes affect how we define job to job movement? If so, how?


# Data Description
## Data Description

+ Primary dataset webscraped from LinkedIn provided by advisor, collected as of early 2019
+ Observations ($n=7,597$) consist of people with a Bachelor's degree from the U.S. or India
+ Publicly available LinkedIn profile with their career progression
+ Most data is discrete or categorical, if numerical then involves monthly increments
+ Some information is truncated or rounded by nature of the dataset

## Features

Roughly $70+$ features, including:

+ Job titles
+ Company names
+ Duration of employment 
+ Total years working in US, studying in US
+ Indicators for Master's and/or Doctorate degrees 
+ Country in which the person's degree was received
+ Field of study
+ Number of years since the most recent degree
+ Highest degree available


# Data Preprocessing / Cleaning

## General Preliminary Cleaning

+ Correcting typos in field of study (BA, MA, and Doctorate)
+ Consolidating fields of study into more narrow categories
+ Consolidating countries (location of degree) into US vs non-US (primarily India)
+ Typecasting
+ Data validation and consistency: e.g. highest degree earned
+ Standardize job industries into categories

## Supplemental Cleaning

Additional variable construction / revision:

+ Number of jobs (retroactively, max 10)
+ Is area of study in a STEM field? : '0' for STEM, '1' for non-STEM
+ `Has Advanced Degree` : '0' is encoded for no advanced degree, '1' is encoded for any advanced degree (Master's or Doctorate)
+ `advanced_degree_from_US` : '0' is encoded for no US advanced degree, '1' is encoded for US advanced degree
+ `STEM_advanced_degree` : '0' is encoded for no STEM advanced degree, '1' is encoded for some STEM advanced degree

This is based on a lot of assumptions: 

+ Our definition of STEM
+ US degrees assumed to hold more weight than foreign degrees

## Proportion of Complete Job Progression to Date

Thresholds based on `n_jobs_clean`:

+ 6206 job spells with 0.50 or greater job spell data availability based on encoded job titles alone
+ 3596 job spells with 0.75 or greater job spell data availability based on encoded job titles alone
+ 2961 job spells with 0.80 or greater job spell data availability based on encoded job titles alone
+ 1720 job spells with 0.90 or greater job spell data availability based on encoded job titles alone
+ 1621 job spells with 1.00 job spell data availability based on encoded job titles alone


# Response Variable Construction

## General Approach

Things to consider:

+ How can we measure internal and external job changes?
+ How can we measure the direction and magnitude of job changes?
+ Promotions, demotions, lateral/stagnant movement?
+ How do we standardize information about jobs with so many of them?

## General Approach (cont.)

Internal Job Changes:

+ Identify common job titles, common bigrams
+ Assign point values to bigrams containing certain words
+ Translate bigram point values to job title point values

External Job Changes:

+ Comparing company names between job $n$ and job $n+1$
+ Fuzzy matching to compare strings
+ Similarity score threshold

## Bigram Point Scale

Five categories:

+ 5 - presidents, ceos, founders
+ 4 - managers
+ 3 - mid-level staff
+ 2 - lower-level staff
+ 1 - students, interns, assistants

Each job title will then take the minimum or average point value of the bigrams it contains.

# Analysis

## Descriptive Analysis: Internal Job Changes

Using the *minimum* bigram point value for each job title, the distribution of job title 
point values and point differences between job $n$ and job $n+1$ are as follows:

## Descriptive Analysis: Internal Job Changes (cont.)

Likewise, using the *average* bigram point value for each job title, the distribution of job title 
point values and point differences between job $n$ and job $n+1$ are as follows:

## Analysis Techniques

**Goal:** Determine what factors are statistically significant when internal or external 
job changes occur, as well as the type and frequency of movement. Statistical methods 
would help us analyze if there exists statistically significant differences between selected 
demographics in the sample.

Possible Models of interest:

+ **Logistic regression:** likelihood of experiencing an internal/external job change, likelihood of ever experiencing an internal/external job change
+ **Cox Proportional Hazards Model / Survival Model:** time before a job change occurs?

Additional Procedures:

+ Elastic Net or LASSO for model selection
+ Statistical T-testing (need to check assumptions)

Methods are openly evolving work in progress.

## Logistic Regression

Current response variables:

+ Likelihood of experiencing an external job movement
+ Likelihood of experiencing a promotion
+ Likelihood of experiencing a demotion

Our set of processed explanatory variables for modeling include:

+ `GenderNums` : '0' is encoded for male, '1' is encoded for female
+ `BA Country` : '0' is encoded for India, '1' is encoded for US
+ `Has Advanced Degree` : '0' for neither Master's nor Doctorate, '1' for either or both
+ `advanced_degree_from_US` : '0' for only received advanced degrees abroad, and '1' for any advanced degree in the US
+ `STEM BA Field` : '0' for non-STEM or unknown BA, '1' for STEM BA
+ `STEM_advanced_degree` :  '0' for only non-STEM, and '1' for any advanced degree in STEM
+ `Total years working in US`
+ `Total years studied US`

Models are not performing very well or are giving errors; hopping between different packages at the moment.

##  Limitations

+ Data collection is done via webscraping; data input will be inconsistent across different people
+ Employment history and duration may not be up to date (as of 2019)
+ Five-point scale is relatively subjective, constructed metric
+ System is not perfect!
+ Imbalances in data, namely "any external changes" variable (proving to be an issue in logistic regression)

# Further Investigation
## Further Investigation

+ Compare pre-COVID baseline behavior to current Indian immigrant sample post-COVID
+ Refine job title categorization / point value assignment process with LLM

# Data Collection

## Data Collection  

+ Defined as "the process of gathering and analyzing accurate data from various sources to find answers to research problems, trends and probabilities, etc., to evaluate possible outcomes" (Jain, 2024).
+ Main objective is to gather information-rich and reliable data, and analyze them to make critical business decisions (Duggal, 2024).
    + What types of data sources?
    + "Garbage in, garbage out" principle
    + Do I have enough data?
    + Multiple features

## Data Sources  

Pre-built data sources:

+ Kaggle: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
+ Governmental sites, CDC, Departmental sites, etc.
+ OpenData NYC
+ GitHub: [https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets)

Web Scraping

+ e.g. Webpages with big tables, LinkedIn data
+ Takes more time, but more flexible
+ BeautifulSoup: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVv6mJpFOb0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVv6mJpFOb0)



# Data Cleaning

## What should be cleaned?  

+ Can you drop irrelevant/empty columns?
+ Are there data entries with ambiguous/invalid characters? (e.g. entries in various languages)
+ Is data typecasted correctly?
+ Are null values coded in different ways? (e.g. "null" vs "NA")
+ Can you conserve space with simpler datatypes? (e.g. encoding strings with integers?)
+ Can you standardize values? (e.g. "canada", "Canada", and "CANADA")
+ Duplications?

# Data Modeling

## What is the role of AI and ML in Data Science?

::: {layout-ncol=2}

+ **Artificial Intelligence:** broad concept of developing machines simulating human thinking, reasoning and behavior.
+ **Machine Learning:** a subset of AI where computer systems learn from the environment to improve experiences and processes.
+ **Data Science:** a distinct discipline with overlap/application in the fields of AI and ML, but not a subset of either.

![](./figures/AI_ML_DS.png)

## What are models used for?

There are various types of modeling depending on your research questions of interest:

+ **Predictive Modeling:** Using historical data to predict future outcomes.
+ **Descriptive Modeling:** Identifying patterns and relationships in data.
+ **Prescriptive Modeling:** Recommending actions based on data analysis.
+ **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points together.
+ **Classification:** Assigning data points to predefined categories.
+ **Regression:** Predicting a continuous outcome variable based on one or more predictor variables.

## Data Evaluation

+ **Accuracy:** How often is the model correct?
+ **Precision:** When it predicts positive, how often is it correct?
+ **Recall:** When it's actually positive, how often does it predict positive?
+ **ROC Curve:** A graphical plot illustrating the diagnostic ability of a binary classifier.
+ **Cross-Validation:** Technique for assessing how the results of a statistical analysis will generalize to an independent dataset.
+ Word of caution: "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure"

# Data Storytelling

## What now?  

+ How to present and communicate your work
+ What does the data support?
+ Context and domain knowledge
+ What does this mean?


## Conclusion

Having a clear framework in place can guide you to make decisions that drive your inquiries, from dirty data to actionable insights!
